Description:
jQuery BBQ leverages the HTML5 hashchange event to allow simple, yet powerful
bookmarkable #hash history. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full .deparam()
method, along with both hash state management, and fragment / query string
parse and merge utility methods.

This library includes the hashchange library from the same author.
